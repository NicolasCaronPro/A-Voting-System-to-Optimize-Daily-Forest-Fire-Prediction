Forest-fire prediction using Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to face major challenges, including (i) the ability to generalize across regions with very different risk profiles, (ii) managing the inherent daily variability and randomness of fire occurrences (including extreme fire days). These factors together have hindered the deployment of dependable prediction systems in operational settings. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-risk modeling framework specifically designed to tackle all two challenges simultaneously. The proposed approach is applied to daily forest-fire prediction across mainland France. We develop a voting-based system that combines the outputs of multiple models trained on signals smoothed with a range of convolutional kernels, capturing both local and seasonal variations. The proposed solution achieves superior performance compared to conventional models, demonstrating improved cross-regional transferability and robustness to daily fluctuations. Notably, it significantly enhances prediction skill for the rare but damaging extreme-fire days, where traditional models often fail. Our experiments reveal that using an ensemble of multiple risk models can better capture the complex dynamics of fire risk and provide more reliable guidance for decision-makers.
